								<h2>About Jacobi</h2>
							</header>
							<p>I currently work for Ultima Genomics, a genome sequencing startup, as a Product Engineer. Previously I was a part-time engineer for Motiv Space Systems, where I worked on risk reduction for NASA JPL's Mars Sample Return mission, specifically CCRS. Prior to that, I interned at Amazon, where I worked on HVAC preventive maintenance and reliability for fulfillment centers. My first internship was at Coco Robotics, where I worked with food delivery robots.</p>
							<p>While at UCLA, I served as president and VP for 3D4E at UCLA (UCLA's only 3D printing club). We won the Community Connection award twice in a row, were nominated for Student Group of the Year, and brought in record amounts of funding during my presidency. I was previously an ASME Combat Robotics Lead and I've also been involved with both Flagship and JV Combat Robotics, where I engineered battlebots for both the 3lb and 15lb weight classes. I also volunteer judged and refereed for the 1lb tournaments.</p>
							<p>I also love music; I've played piano for seventeen years (and counting!), played competitively for three, and played as an accompanist for choirs and soloists. I have experience in studio art as well. Feel free to see some of my creative projects by going to my portfolio!</p>
							<p>To see more about what I'm working on at the moment and my experience, please scroll down to the "Contact Me" section for my contact information and resume.</p>

								<h2>My Interests<br />
								</h2>
							</header>
							<p>My main interests within engineering are Product Development and Design, Systems and Reliability/Testing, and Operations. </p>
							<p>I also have experience in writing and communications, which is why I chose to study Public Affairs. I enjoy writing about and researching interesting political and social issues, especially those relating to modern technological advances. I like to look at public policy through quantitative and qualitative lenses, and I have experience in data analysis in policy.</p>
